I"C<p>I have been working extra these days so my wife has to also work extra and take care of the babies, me and helself.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to the supermarket after a rough night of overworking, I was like: “Oh I am going to buy her a coke, or a chocolate, something nice for being there”.
so I picked a lot of stuff: fruits, some nice lunch, icecream, coke, chocolate (yeah suhar), and when I went to pay it was a bill of €26, but I couldn’t pay.
And I did several attempts, but the pos was not picking my card, so I had to return everything and walk with the hands empty, the shame and sadness on my face
and also late for work.
<em>Apparently I had only €25 on the bank. €1 more and I could buy everything.</em></p>

<p>Today I went again with a different card, I bought everything, but it was magical: it was the same cashier lady from yesterday, she looked at me, I looked at her,
she slowly passed the products on the reader, she looked at me again, it was again €28, I insert the other card today, then…. no error, everything went fine,
she started smiling a look, and said some funny things on German (I live in Berlin, but I don’t speak the language), she smiled more, almost laughed, she 
had a moment of joy. this only happened because of a bad experience the last day.</p>

<p>Life works in misterious ways!!</p>
