I have been working extra these days, so my wife has to also work extra and take care of the babies, me and herself.

Yesterday I went to the supermarket after a rough night of overworking. I was like: "Oh I am going to buy her a coke or a chocolate, something nice for being there", so I picked a lot of stuff: fruits, some nice lunch, icecream, coke, chocolate (yeah sugar), and when I went to pay it was a bill of €26, but I couldn't pay.
And I did several attempts, but the pos was not picking my card, so I had to return everything and walk with the hands empty, the shame and sadness on my face
and also late for work.
*Apparently I had only €25 on the bank. €1 more and I could buy everything.*

Today I went again with a different card. I bought everything, but it was magical: it was the same cashier lady from yesterday. she looked at me, I looked at her,
she slowly passed the products on the barcode reader, she looked at me again, it was again €28, I inserted the other card today, then... ...no error, everything went fine,
she started smiling a look and said some funny things on German, she smiled more, almost laughed, she 
had a moment of joy. I had a moment of joy. this only happened because of a bad experience the previous day. now I laugh and tell about it

Life works in mysterious ways!!
