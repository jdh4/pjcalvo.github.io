# webdriverIO and tests driven by input data ("data driven tests")
**one thing I really like and dislike about javaScript is that there is not a single-better option of doing the same thing**
 
what I mean is that the language provides you with enough flexibility to write the same functionality in many different ways,and deciding which is the best or worst way to implement it, will probably be very subjetive. 

**so when writing UI tests I find it very handy to use the following implementation to write data driven tests**

```javascript
// include pages
const Home = require('../../home.po');
...

// define data source

tests = [
  	{
      issue:"MOD-001",
      user:{
        username:"pepito@",
        password:"notequiere",
        status:"valid"
      },
      result:true
    },
    {
      issue:"MOD-002",
      user:{
        username:"pepito@",
        password:"sitequiere",
        status:"invalid",
      },
      result:true
    }
];

//now we write the spec

tests.forEach(({ issue, user, result }) => {

  	describe(`[{ issue }] When the user is { user.status } then the tests result should be { result }`, () => {
  		before(() => {
    		Home.open();
  	  });
      
      //its and steps go here
      it(`Attempt to login with user: { user.username }/{ user.password }`, () => {
        Home.loginWithUser(user);
      })
      
      ...
      
      it ('This is the verification', () => {
        // verification changes here
        expect(Home.isUserSignedIn()).to.equal(result);
      });
      
      after(() => {
        //cleackCookies, signout or somehting
      });
      
}); // end of foreach loop
```

This approach is really handy to manage scenarios with a lot of repetitive steps in which the test outcome will be determined by the test input. This approach is also not magical at all, and it does not uses any extra dependencies; this can accomplish because the specs and tests are generated by wdio runner during runtime which means that you are dynamically creating new specs for each new test input given.

Thoughts?
